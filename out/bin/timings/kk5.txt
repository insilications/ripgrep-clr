BOLT-INFO: forcing -jump-tables=move as PIC jump table was detected in function __sysconf/1(*3)
BOLT-INFO: 537 out of 3051 functions in the binary (17.6%) have non-empty execution profile
BOLT-INFO: 28 functions with profile could not be optimized
BOLT-INFO: profile for 1 objects was ignored
BOLT-INFO: the input contains 2221 (dynamic count : 800050) opportunities for macro-fusion optimization. Will fix instances on a hot path.
BOLT-INFO: Profile bias score: 2.6590% StDev: 12.0349%
BOLT-INFO: 181402 instructions were shortened
BOLT-INFO: removed 6380 empty blocks
BOLT-INFO: merged 1 duplicate CFG edge
BOLT-INFO: removed 1 'repz' prefixes with estimated execution count of 0 times.
BOLT-INFO: ICF folded 214 out of 3051 functions in 4 passes. 1 functions had jump tables.
BOLT-INFO: Removing all identical functions will save 27.57 KB of code space. Folded functions were called 182 times based on profile.
BOLT-INFO: basic block reordering modified layout of 341 (12.02%) functions
BOLT-INFO: UCE removed 3 blocks and 15 bytes of code.
BOLT-INFO: splitting separates 749036 hot bytes from 1900426 cold bytes (28.27% of split functions is hot).
BOLT-INFO: 30 Functions were reordered by LoopInversionPass
